# Exercise 1

A) Consider the following stochastic field: 

$$
E(x)=10(1+f(x))
$$

where f(x) is a zero-mean stationary Gaussian field with unit variance and $x \in[0,5](m)$. The autocorrelation function for f is $R_{f}(\tau)=\exp (-|\tau| / 2)$.

1. Use the Karhunen-Loeve series expansion method to generate N=5000 realizations of the field E(x). 
2. Justify the number of terms you retained in the KL-expansion.
3. Calculate the ensemble average and the ensemble variance from these realizations. To which values would they converge as we increase the number N of realizations?

B) Consider the zero-mean Gaussian process X(t), t∈[0,10] (sec),  which has the following one-sided power-spectrum
G(ω)={■(ω-1,    1≤ω≤2@3-ω,    2<ω≤3@0,             otherwise)┤    

	Use the Spectral Representation method to generate N=5000 time-histories (realizations) of the process X(t).
	Calculate the ensemble average and the ensemble variance from these time-histories. To which values would they converge as we increased the number N of realizations.
	Calculate the temporal average and temporal variance from a single realization. What do you observe?
